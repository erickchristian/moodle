zdrive.php, combined with a few core modifications, allows
users to access their personal share (home folder in AD) in
the private files area. The file is based off of Victor M.
Varela's smbwebclient, a copy of which can be found in this
directory.

zdrive.php contains sensitive info, and as a result, has
been added to this directory's .gitignore file. In case of
complete catastrophe where you may find yourself without a
complete copy of the script, a bak of the file has been
stripped down and left here for your convenience. Should
you need to make use of it simply find the following in the
file and replace it with the proper information.
